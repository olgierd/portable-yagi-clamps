# portable-yagi-clamps
3d printable clamps for DIY yagi antennas.

## How to print?

I'm using https://dkprojects.net/openscad-threads/ library to render threads. Place is in this directory in order to correctly render the STL.

I've printed mine using PLA, 0.2 mm layer, 0.4 mm nozzle, no supports.

It's designed for 22 mm PCV electrical conduit pipe as boom, but you can adjust it to any size.

Use M3x10 screw to secure a clamp on the boom.
