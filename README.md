3d printable clamps for DIY yagi antennas.

## How to print?

I'm using https://dkprojects.net/openscad-threads/ library to render threads. Place it in this directory in order to correctly render the STL.

I've printed mine using PLA, 0.2 mm layer, 0.4 mm nozzle, no supports.

It's designed for 22 mm PCV electrical conduit pipe as boom, but you can adjust it to any size.

Use M3x10 screw to secure a clamp on the boom.

## Dipole

You'll need SMA socket mounted using two screws.

Ground connection (right dipole arm) is made using 4 mm wide nickel strip. Make a hole, so M2.5 SMA screw will go through and route it through the cut in the thread.

Center conductor - solder a short piece of stranded wire to SMA's central pin, route through hole, add a bit of nickel tape on top, secure using glue. Voila.
